The project I worked on involved creating a database with tables for products, customers, employees, stores, and sales. The database was designed to store information about the sales transactions, including the date of the sale, the products sold, the customer who made the purchase, the employee who assisted the customer, and the store location where the sale took place.

To showcase the capabilities of the database, I wrote several SQL queries to retrieve specific information, such as sales data for a particular location, sales data for male customers, and a list of products purchased by male customers.

Overall, the project helped me gain experience in database design and management, as well as using SQL to query and analyze data.
